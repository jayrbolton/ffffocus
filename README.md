# ffffffffffffffffocus

This is a tiny frontend app that I use to help myself focus and get faster at working. It's like the Pomodoro Technique, but is instead goal-oriented. You enter the outcome for a short but significant task, and you set a goal time you want to complete it between 5-30 minutes. During that time, try really hard to focus on the task and complete it before the timer is up! If you need more time, set another goal. Then, take a break after you do a handful of tasks. The app will keep a history of all your tasks with completion times.

I built this using this flim-flam frontend architecture: [https://github.com/jayrbolton/functional-frontend-architecture](https://github.com/jayrbolton/functional-frontend-architecture)

It will cache all your completed tasks to localStorage and will save your task history until you clear your browser.
